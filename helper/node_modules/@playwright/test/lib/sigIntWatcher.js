      // When running through NPM we might get multiple SIGINT signals

      // with default handler without printing the results.
      // We work around this by giving NPM 1000ms to send us duplicate signals.
      // The side effect is that slow shutdown or bug in our runner will force
      // the user to hit Ctrl+C again after at least a second.
