 * - self (Will return the current window instance for supported browsers)
 * - window (fallback for older browser implementations)
 * - global (NodeJS standard)
 * - <null> (When all else fails)
 * While the return type is a Window for the normal case, not all environments will support all

 * for older browsers that do not define Object.create eg. ES3 only, IE8 just in case any page checks for presence/absence of the prototype implementation.
 * Note: For consistency this will not use the Object.create implementation if it exists as this would cause a testing requirement to test with and without the implementations
