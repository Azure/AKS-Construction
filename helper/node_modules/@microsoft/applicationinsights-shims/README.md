Shims for the Application Insights Javascript SDK

This project exists to break the dependency on the version of tslib that is used during the build and deploy, this is
mostly due to several breaking changes that have reduced our ability to publish fixes.

While the Application Insights JS SDK will use the stubs defined in this packaging for the browser instances (those that are
uploaded to the CDN) they are built using the polyfill pattern, so if a global implementation of __extends() and __assign() already exist
those versions will be used.

## Global __extends() and __assign() changes - v2.0.0 or greater

From v2.0.0 or greater the globally defined ```__extends()``` and ```__assign()``` methods are no longer exposed as global by default.

If you need to expose the TsLib helpers globally (which occurred by default for v1.x.x) you now will need to import and call the ```__exposeGlobalTsLib()``` function.

```javascript
import { __exposeGlobalTsLib } from "@microsoft/applicationinsights-shims";

__exposeGlobalTsLib();
```

## Build:
```
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install
npm run build --silent
```

## Run unit tests:
```
npm run test
```
