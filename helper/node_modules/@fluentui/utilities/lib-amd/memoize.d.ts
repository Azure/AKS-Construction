 * Memoizes a function; when you pass in the same parameters multiple times, it returns a cached result.
 * Be careful when passing in objects, you need to pass in the same INSTANCE for caching to work. Otherwise

 * undefined for a value and relying on a default function will execute it the first time, but will not
 * re-evaluate subsequent times which may have been unexpected.
 *
 * By default, the cache will reset after 100 permutations, to avoid abuse cases where the function is
 * unintendedly called with unique objects. Without a reset, the cache could grow infinitely, so we safeguard
 * by resetting. To override this behavior, pass a value of 0 to the maxCacheSize parameter.

 * If the flag is set to true, the callback result is recomputed every time till the callback result is
 * not undefined/null for the first time, and then the non-undefined/null version gets cached.
